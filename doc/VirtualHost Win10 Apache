Sample Virtual Host name: MySoft.com

1. Edit file "hosts" on Win10 in directory:

C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc

Add this line:

MySoft.com  127.0.0.1

Your hosts file should looks like that:
"
# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost
	127.0.0.1	mobiledrug.com
  127.0.0.1 MySoft.com
"

Line that begins from "#" is a comment and system will not read that.

2. Is there is a problem with saving that file, you have to change permission by adding 
rule "modify".

3. Run ping command from windows command line:
"WinKey + R" + "cmd" + Enter.

Ping MySoft.com 

C:\Users>ping MySoft.com

Your console should looks like that below:

"

4. Edit file httpd.conf from Apache directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf

On the bottom of that file add:
"
Include "conf/mysoftcom.conf"
"
Close httpd.conf.

5. In the directory C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache24\conf\
create file mysoftcom.conf with:
"
Listen 127.0.0.1:80
AllowEncodedSlashes On

<VirtualHost mysoft.com:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:\Users\Grzegorz\source\repos\CannotResist\apt\src"
    ServerName mysoft.com
        <Directory "C:\Users\Grzegorz\source\repos\CannotResist\apt\src">
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
"

The DocumentRoot should be your web application directory.

6. Restart you Apache web server to read new configuration files. 

7. If apache desn't restart go to command line and run:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache24\bin\httpd.exe -t -D DUMP_VHOSTS
